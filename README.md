## Usage

### Admin

To add categories, you must do it through the admin panel.\
Do not create any account where the owner is an administrator except the `Bank` one.\
Do not create transaction from admin panel (if you do, there is no accounts update).\
Else you can edit all Accounts

### User

<span style="color: green">// `Bank` account only usable on credit or debit transaction</span>

Transaction color code:
- `Betweens accounts: 🟦`
- `Credit: 🟥`
- `Debit: 🟩`

You can make transactions betweens accounts:

Or simulate an external transaction (such as an in-store purchase) by credit or debit (automatically select `Bank` account):
